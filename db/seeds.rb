# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# User.destroy_all
#
# user1 = User.create(
#   username: "clairemuller",
#   email: "cmuller@hotmail.com",
#   location: "Seattle",
#   pet_name: "George",
#   pet_age: 2,
#   pet_bio: "George is a cute kitty with a big personality!",
# )
# pet_pic: "george.jpg"

# user1.pet_pic.attach(io: File.open("app/assets/images/george.jpg"), filename: 'george2.jpg')
