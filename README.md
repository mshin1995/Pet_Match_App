### Built by Matt Shin and Claire Muller

PetMatchr is Tinder for your pets! Users create a profile with a picture and short bio. Once the profile is set up, a user can like and dislike other users; if both like each other, it's a match! Once a match is made, users can start a conversation.

This app was a partner project built as part of the Flatiron School's Web Development immersive curriculum. After five weeks of learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails, we were tasked with building a fully functioning website in Rails.
